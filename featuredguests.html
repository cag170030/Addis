<p>Austin Zhang is a multi-disciplinary artist who uses composition, improvisation, videography, photography, and writing in his work. Mentored by masters of music from George Garzone and Jaleel Shaw to Wynton Marsalis and Stefon Harris, Austin has had incredible examples to follow artistically and personally. During his high school and collegiate career, Austin took his talents to Jazz at Lincoln Center, Newport Jazz Festival, and Carnegie Hall and on stage with the likes of Terri Lyne Carrington and Wycliffe Gordon.</p> 

<p>While studying at the Manhattan School of Music, Austin began to explore other avenues of artistry as he immersed himself into great works of Pablo Picasso, James Joyce, Mary Shelley, and others. Today, Austin maintains a YouTube channel, blogs, and performs regularly with his two main projects, The Beehive Quartet and Honesty Band. Impassioned by both “art for arts sake” as well as art for the issues we face, Austin’s music, writings, and visual works explore aesthetic and artistic beauty as well as criticisms of social injustice, animal exploitation, and environmental destruction.</p>
