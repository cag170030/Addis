<p>Decomposing an analog signal as a Fourier series reveals an infinite sum of constituent sine waves; decomposing the music of Chirag Gokani reveals an infinite sum of musical influences. Indeed, the Dallas-based electric bassist has developed a unique sound that fuses jazz, blues, classical, country, and Hindustani music, as well as sounds from nature.</p>

<p>Chirag can be heard on as a featured artist or sideman on five studio albums and is frequently found playing with jazz and blues bands around Dallas. Chirag also pursues his interest in astrophysics as a Eugene McDermott Scholar at the University of Texas at Dallas.</p>

<p>In his free time, Chirag <a href="https://cag170030.github.io/Custom-Chimes/">handcrafts wind chimes and chime trees</a> to benefit the North Texas Food Bank.</p>
