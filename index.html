<p align="middle">Michelle, </p>
<p>Abstract artist Michelle Stroescu was born and raised among the beauty of the North Carolina and Tennessee mountains. She graduated with a BFA in Graphic Design and a MAT from East Tennessee State University.</p> 
<p>Her keen sense of color and design was promoted throughout her 17 year career in design and product development in the fashion industry. Transplanted to Texas with her job in 1998 she quickly fell in love with the big open sky and the endless color schemes found in the Texas landscape. Under that influence, in 2007 she made the decision to leave her corporate post as VP Product Development and pursue her art professionally.</p>
<p>Elements of nature, both seen and unseen, are influential in her paintings and process. Stroescu comments, "Nature, season, strife, cosmos, emotion, spirit, culture, music, and relationships, all affect my work at some intersection. I'm a Master of Curiosity that continually seeks inspiration from every corner and crevice imaginable."</p>

<p>Her studio is in far north Dallas surrounded by lots of light, space, and nature to inspire.</p>
