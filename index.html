<h3 align="middle">Michelle Stroescu, vocals</h3>    
<img src="michelle.jpg" width="205" height="273" style = "display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"/>
<p>Abstract artist Michelle Stroescu was born and raised among the beauty of the North Carolina and Tennessee mountains. She graduated with a BFA in Graphic Design and a MAT from East Tennessee State University. Her keen sense of color and design was promoted throughout her 17 year career in design and product development in the fashion industry.</p>
<p>Transplanted to Texas with her job in 1998 she quickly fell in love with the big open sky and the endless color schemes found in the Texas landscape. Under that influence, in 2007 she made the decision to leave her corporate post as VP Product Development and pursue her art professionally.</p>
<p>Elements of nature, both seen and unseen, are influential in her paintings and process. Acrylic and guoache are her primary mediums. In 2014 she began studying and using the encaustic method. Her work is widely recognized and can be found in private collections across the country.</p>
<p>Michelle is also deeply musical, graciously sharing her talent as a singer with Addis. Her eclectic taste in music enlivens our performances and expands our musical horizons.</p>

<p>Colman plays drum set in the Jasper High School jazz band and is the Drum Captain during marching season. He currently plays with multiple jazz combos including the Colman Burks Sextet and Quartet. Colman started piano lessons at the age of 5 and studied it for five years. He was in percussion in sixth grade and got his drum set the following summer; after that he never stopped playing. Inspired by his second cousin funk drummer Stanton Moore, he began to explore funk and jazz styles.</p>

<p>Christian Kondor fell in love once, and he's been writing and singing songs about it ever since. He learned piano at a young age from some very talented folks, taught himself guitar on a second-hand Fender, and learned to sing the blues by screaming along to an awful lot of punk rock. Christian started making guest appearances with Addis in fall of 2018, and hopes to release his first solo album in late 2019.</p>
