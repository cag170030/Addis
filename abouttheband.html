<p>Decomposing an analog signal as a Fourier series reveals an infinite sum of constituent sine waves; decomposing the music of Chirag Gokani reveals an infinite sum of musical influences. Indeed, the Dallas-area electric bassist is equally at home in jazz, blues, R&B, country, Hindustani, and world settings. Chirag is frequently found playing with bands of diverse styles around Dallas and can be heard as a featured artist or sideman on five studio albums. He has shared the stage with the likes of Jim Suhler, Steve Miller, Joel Foy, Tony Baker, Gerard Bendiks, Chris Borin, Kelly Durbin, Steve Barnes, and Austin Zhang.</p>
